## Manifest Attributes
Everywhere the word “list” is mentioned, it is whitespace-separated.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application-ID | the application’s unique ID (e.g. com.acme.foo_app) |
| Application-Version | the application’s version |
| Application-Name | the human-readable name of the application |
| Application-Class | the application’s main class |
| Application | the Maven coordinates of the application’s main JAR or the path of the main JAR within the capsule |
| Application-Script | a startup script to be run instead of Application-Class, given as a path relative to the capsule’s root |
| Min-Java-Version | the lowest Java version required to run the application; Capsule will look for an appropriate installation |
| Min-Update-Version | a space-separated key-value (‘=’ separated) list mapping Java versions to the minimum update version required |
| Java-Version | the highest version of the Java installation required to run the application; Capsule will look for an appropriate installation |
| JDK-Required | if set to true, the Capsule will only be launched using a JDK, if one matching the requested versions is found. |
| JVM-Args | a list of JVM arguments that will be used to launch the application’s Java process |
| Args | the list of command line arguments to be passed to the application; the UNIX shell-style special variables ($*, $1, $2, …) can refer to the actual arguments passed on the capsule’s command line; if no special var is used, the listed values will be prepended to the supplied arguments (i.e., as if $* had been listed last). |
| Environment-Variables | a list of environment variables that will be put in the applications environment; formatted var=value or var |
| System-Properties | a list of system properties that will be defined in the applications JVM; formatted prop=value or prop |
| App-Class-Path | a list of JARs, relative to the capsule root, that will be put on the application’s classpath, in the order they are listed |
| Capsule-In-Class-Path | if set to false, the capsule JAR itself will not be on the application’s classpath (default: true) |
| Boot-Class-Path | a list of JARs, dependencies, and/or directories, relative to the capsule root, that will be used as the application’s boot classpath |
| Boot-Class-Path-A | a list of JARs dependencies, and/or directories, relative to the capsule root, that will be appended to the applications default boot classpath |
| Boot-Class-Path-P | a list of JARs dependencies, and/or directories, relative to the capsule root, that will be prepended to the applications default boot classpath |
| Library-Path-A | a list of JARs and/or directories, relative to the capsule root, that will be appended to the default native library path |
| Library-Path-P | a list of JARs and/or directories, relative to the capsule root, that will be prepended to the default native library path |
| Security-Manager | the name of a class that will serve as the application’s security-manager |
| Security-Policy | a security policy file, relative to the capsule root, that will be used as the security policy |
| Security-Policy-A | a security policy file, relative to the capsule root, that will be appended to the default security policy |
| Java-Agents | a list of Java agents used by the application; formatted agent or agent=arg1,arg2..., where agent is either the path to a JAR relative to the capsule root, or a Maven coordinate of a dependency |
| Native-Agents | a list of native JVMTI agents used by the application; formatted “agent” or “agent=arg1,arg2…”, where agent is either the path to a native library, without the platform-specific suffix, relative to the capsule root; the native library file(s) can be embedded in the capsule or listed as Maven native dependencies using the Native-Dependencies-… attributes. |
| Dependencies | a list of dependencies given as groupId:artifactId:version[(excludeGroupId:excludeArtifactId,...)] |
| Native-Dependencies | a list of dependencies consisting of .so artifacts for Linux; each item can be a key-value pair (‘=’ separated), with the second component being a new name to give the artifact |
| Capsule-Log-Level | sets the default log level for the Capsule launcher (which can be overridden with -Dcapsule.log); can be one of: NONE, QUIET (the default), VERBOSE, or DEBUG. |
| Caplets | a list of names of caplet classes – if embedded in the capsule – or Maven coordinates of caplet artifacts that will be applied to the capsule in the order they are listed. |

## Manifest Variables

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $CAPSULE_JAR | the full path to the capsule JAR |
| $CAPSULE_DIR | the full path to the application cache directory, if the capsule is extracted. |
| $JAVA_HOME | the full path to the Java installation which will be used to launch the app |

## Actions

Actions are system properties that, if defined, perform an action other than launching the application.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| capsule.version | prints the application ID and the Capsule version |
| capsule.introspect | prints the values of all attributes. The attribute values are printed after manipulation by caplets, but before any further resolution. |
| capsule.jvms | prints the JVM installations it can locate with their versions |
| capsule.modes | prints all available capsule modes |
| capsule.help | prints usage instructions | 

## System Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| capsule.mode | if set, the capsule will be launched in the specified mode (see Capsule Configuration and Modes) |
| capsule.log | can be set to ‘none’/’quiet’ (default)/’verbose’/’debug’ |
| capsule.jvm.args | specifies JVM arguments for the capsule’s app process. |
| capsule.reset | if set, forces re-extraction of the capsule, where applies, and/or re-downloading of SNAPSHOT dependencies |
| capsule.java.home | forces the capsule to use the given path to a Java installation when launching the application. |
| capsule.java.cmd | forces the capsule to use the give executable to launch the JVM. |

Capsule defines these system properties in the application’s process:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| capsule.app | the app ID |
| capsule.jar | the full path to the capsule’s JAR |
| capsule.dir | if the JAR has been extracted, the full path of the application cache (use generally discouraged). |

Capsule defines these system properties in the capsule (launcher) process (to be queried by jcmd):

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| capsule.app.pid | the child (application) process PID; available only in POSIX environments. |

## Environment Variables

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CAPSULE_CACHE_NAME | sets the name of the root of Capsule’s cache in the default location (~ on Unix, %LOCALAPPDATA% on Windows) |
| CAPSULE_CACHE_DIR | sets the full path of the Capsule’s cache |

Capsule defines these variables in the application’s environment:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CAPSULE_APP | the app ID |
| CAPSULE_JAR | the full path to the capsule’s JAR |
| CAPSULE_DIR | if the JAR has been extracted, the full path of the application cache. |

These values can also be accessed with $VARNAME in any capsule manifest attributes.
